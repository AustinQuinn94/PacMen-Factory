# PacMen-Factory
## This project should generate a  pac man in the window at the click of the "add pac-man" button and assigns it a random velocity in both the x and y directions, remaining idle until the "start game" button has been pressed. Each pac-man generated should then be able to identify a collision with the edge of the window and reverse the respective velocity in order to bounce off the edge and continue

### to run this program, clone the repository and then open the index.html in your browser 

#### currently the image of pac-man is static only using pacman1.png coming back to this project I intend to add a loop that will allow each created token to oscilate between the open mouth and closed mouth variants as it moves, as well as implement code so that images 3 and 4 get utilized when the velocity in the x direction is negative
